The program works through four classes, as follows:
	# BoundedBuffer
Deals specifically with the creation of a BoundedBuffer - at basics, a String
array that is added to and removed from on a FIFO basis.
	# Producer
Deals specifically with the reading of String from the client and adds them
to the BoundedBuffer, with the username taken from the client attached in order
to allow the Consumer class to access these and send them out to each connected
client.
	# Consumer
Keeps track of the currently connected clients and usernames, and interacts with
the buffer to communicate messages from the buffer to these.
	# ChatServer
Used as the main class in order to set up the required Socket, Profucer,
BoundedBuffer and Consumer variables in order to interact with the Applet.

The program works from the command line in a terminal (or cmd). It accepts
information from the chat.html file used within the applet to populate a
username, port number, etc.

The program then runs, using threads in order to both read input from the
connected clients and write these to the BoundedBuffer, and write from the
BoundedBuffer to each connected client. This continues until there are no
clients attached.
